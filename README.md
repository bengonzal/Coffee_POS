# Coffee_POS
This is a personal project trying to create my own version of a Point of Sale system for a coffee shop. The project is done using Java as the backbone and JavaFX as the GUI implementation. 

* Separate Classes for each beverage
* A class for an entire order that will be made of up beverage objects
* Some sort of database (DB) to hold all orders
* A functional GUI that lets the user easily create, modify, and save orders

All menu items must contain at least the following: 
* Item name
* Price
* Description 

Beverages: 
* Espresso
* Cold Brew
* Latte
* Tea

Order:
Contains at least 
* A single menu item
* Total order price
* Number of items in order 
GUI:
